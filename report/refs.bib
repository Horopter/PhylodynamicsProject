	abstract = {We present a formalism for unifying the inference of population size from genetic sequences and mathematical models of infectious disease in populations. Virus phylogenies have been used in many recent studies to infer properties of epidemics. These approaches rely on coalescent models that may not be appropriate for infectious diseases. We account for phylogenetic patterns of viruses in susceptible–infected (SI), susceptible–infected–susceptible (SIS), and susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) models of infectious disease, and our approach may be a viable alternative to demographic models used to reconstruct epidemic dynamics. The method allows epidemiological parameters, such as the reproductive number, to be estimated directly from viral sequence data. We also describe patterns of phylogenetic clustering that are often construed as arising from a short chain of transmissions. Our model reproduces the moments of the distribution of phylogenetic cluster sizes and may therefore serve as a null hypothesis for cluster sizes under simple epidemiological models. We examine a small cross-sectional sample of human immunodeficiency (HIV)-1 sequences collected in the United States and compare our results to standard estimates of effective population size. Estimated prevalence is consistent with estimates of effective population size and the known history of the HIV epidemic. While our model accurately estimates prevalence during exponential growth, we find that periods of decline are harder to identify.},

	abstract = {Longitudinal healthcare claims databases are frequently used for studying the comparative safety and effectiveness of medications, but results from these studies may be biased due to residual confounding. It is unclear whether methods for confounding adjustment that have been shown to perform well in small, simple nonrandomized studies are applicable to the large, complex pharmacoepidemiologic studies created from secondary healthcare data. Ordinary simulation approaches for evaluating the performance of statistical methods do not capture important features of healthcare claims. A statistical framework for creating replicated simulation datasets from an empirical cohort study in electronic healthcare claims data is developed and validated. The approach relies on resampling from the observed covariate and exposure data without modification in all simulated datasets to preserve the associations among these variables. Repeated outcomes are simulated using a true treatment effect of the investigator's choice and the baseline hazard function estimated from the empirical data. As an example, this framework is applied to a study of high versus low-intensity statin use and cardiovascular outcomes. Simulated data is based on real data drawn from Medicare Parts A and B linked with a prescription drug insurance claims database maintained by Caremark. Properties of the data simulated using this framework are compared with the empirical data on which the simulations were based. In addition, the simulated datasets are used to compare variable selection strategies for confounder adjustmentvia the propensity score, including high-dimensional approaches that could not be evaluated with ordinary simulation methods. The simulated datasets are found to closely resemble the observed complex data structure but have the advantage of an investigator-specified exposure effect.},

	abstract = {Viral phylodynamics is defined as the study of how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape viral phylogenies. Since the coining of the term in 2004, research on viral phylodynamics has focused on transmission dynamics in an effort to shed light on how these dynamics impact viral genetic variation. Transmission dynamics can be considered at the level of cells within an infected host, individual hosts within a population, or entire populations of hosts. Many viruses, especially RNA viruses, rapidly accumulate genetic variation because of short generation times and high mutation rates. Patterns of viral genetic variation are therefore heavily influenced by how quickly transmission occurs and by which entities transmit to one another. Patterns of viral genetic variation will also be affected by selection acting on viral phenotypes. Although viruses can differ with respect to many phenotypes, phylodynamic studies have to date tended to focus on a limited number of viral phenotypes. These include virulence phenotypes, phenotypes associated with viral transmissibility, cell or tissue tropism phenotypes, and antigenic phenotypes that can facilitate escape from host immunity. Due to the impact that transmission dynamics and selection can have on viral genetic variation, viral phylogenies can therefore be used to investigate important epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes, such as epidemic spread [2], spatio-temporal dynamics including metapopulation dynamics [3], zoonotic transmission, tissue tropism [4], and antigenic drift [5]. The quantitative investigation of these processes through the consideration of viral phylogenies is the central aim of viral phylodynamics.},

	abstract = {Estimates of the coalescent effective population size Ne can be poorly correlated with the true population size. The relationship between Ne and the population size is sensitive to the way in which birth and death rates vary over time. The problem of inference is exacerbated when the mechanisms underlying population dynamics are complex and depend on many parameters. In instances where nonparametric estimators of Ne such as the skyline struggle to reproduce the correct demographic history, model-based estimators that can draw on prior information about population size and growth rates may be more efficient. A coalescent model is developed for a large class of populations such that the demographic history is described by a deterministic nonlinear dynamical system of arbitrary dimension. This class of demographic model differs from those typically used in population genetics. Birth and death rates are not fixed, and no assumptions are made regarding the fraction of the population sampled. Furthermore, the population may be structured in such a way that gene copies reproduce both within and across demes. For this large class of models, it is shown how to derive the rate of coalescence, as well as the likelihood of a gene genealogy with heterochronous sampling and labeled taxa, and how to simulate a coalescent tree conditional on a complex demographic history. This theoretical framework encapsulates many of the models used by ecologists and epidemiologists and should facilitate the integration of population genetics with the study of mathematical population dynamics.},

	abstract = {Phylodynamic methods provide a coherent framework for the inference of population parameters directly from genetic data. They are an important tool for understanding both the spread of epidemics as well as long-term macroevolutionary trends in speciation and extinction. In particular, phylodynamic methods based on multitype birth–death models have been used to infer the evolution of discrete traits, the movement of individuals or pathogens between geographic locations or host types, and the transition of infected individuals between disease stages. In these models, population heterogeneity is treated by assigning individuals to different discrete types. Typically, methods which allow inference of parameters under multitype birth–death models integrate over the possible birth–death trajectories (i.e. the type-specific population size functions) to reduce the computational demands of the inference. As a result, it has not been possible to use these methods to directly infer the dynamics of trait-specific population sizes, infected host counts or other such demographic quantities. In this article, we present a method which infers these multitype trajectories with minimal additional computational cost beyond that of existing methods. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach by applying it to a previously published set of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomes, inferring the numbers of human and camel cases through time, together with the number and timing of spillovers from the camel reservoir. This application highlights the multitype population trajectory’s ability to elucidate properties of the population which are not directly ancestral to its sampled members.},

By combining recent advances in phylodynamic modeling, scalable Bayesian inference and differentiable programming, along with a few tailored heuristics, VBSKY is capable of analyzing thousands of genomes in a few minutes, providing accurate estimates of epidemiologically relevant quantities such as the effective reproduction number and overall sampling effort through time. We illustrate the utility of our method by performing a rapid analysis of a large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and demonstrate that the resulting estimates closely track those derived from alternative sources of public health data.},

Such structure may be due to spatial segregation, but may also reflect any other gene-flow-limiting aspect of a model. In combination with the structured coalescent, this fact can be used to inform phylogenetic tree reconstruction, as well as to infer parameters such as migration rates and subpopulation sizes from annotated sequence data. However, conducting Bayesian inference under the structured coalescent is impeded by the difficulty of constructing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms (samplers) capable of efficiently exploring the state space.Results: In this article, we present a new MCMC sampler capable of sampling from posterior distributions over structured trees: timed phylogenetic trees in which lineages are associated with the distinct subpopulation in which they lie. The sampler includes a set of MCMC proposal functions that offer significant mixing improvements over a previously published method. Furthermore, its implementation as a BEAST 2 package ensures maximum flexibility with respect to model and prior specification. We demonstrate the usefulness of this new sampler by using it to infer migration rates and effective population sizes of H3N2 influenza between New Zealand, New York and Hong Kong from publicly available hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences under the structured coalescent.Availability and implementation: The sampler has been implemented as a publicly available BEAST 2 package that is distributed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License at http://compevol.github.io/MultiTypeTree.Contact:  tgvaughan@gmail.comSupplementary information:  Supplementary Data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Phylodynamics bridges the gap between classical epidemiology and pathogen genome sequence data by estimating epidemiological parameters from time-scaled pathogen phylogenetic trees. The models used in phylodynamics typically assume that the sampling procedure is independent between infected individuals. However, this assumption does not hold for many epidemics, in particular for such sexually transmitted infections as HIV-1, for which contact tracing schemes are included in health policies of many countries. We extended phylodynamic multi-type birth-death (MTBD) models with contact tracing (CT), and developed a simulator to generate trees under MTBD and MTBD-CT models. We proposed a non-parametric test for detecting contact tracing in pathogen phylogenetic trees. Its application to simulated data showed that it is both highly specific and sensitive. For the simplest representative of the MTBD-CT family, the BD-CT(1) model, where only the last contact can be notified, we solved the differential equations and proposed a closed form solution for the likelihood function. We implemented a maximum-likelihood program, which estimates the BD-CT(1) model parameters and their confidence intervals from phylogenetic trees. It performed accurate parameter inference on BD and BD-CT(1) simulated data, and detected contact tracing in HIV-1 B epidemics in Zurich and the UK. Importantly, we showed that not accounting for contact tracing when it is present, leads to bias in parameter estimation with the BD model (overestimation of the becoming-non-infectious rate). This bias is also present, but greatly reduced, when the BD-CT(1) model is used on data where multiple contacts can be notified. Our CT test, MTBD-CT tree simulator and BD-CT(1) parameter estimator are freely available at GitHub (evolbioinfo/treesimulator and evolbioinfo/bdct).},

In this paper, we analyze the constant rate birth–death process with incomplete sampling. We derive the density of the bifurcation events for trees on n leaves which evolved under this birth–death-sampling process. This density is used for calculating prior distributions in Bayesian inference programs and for efficiently simulating trees. We show that the birth–death-sampling process can be interpreted as a birth–death process with reduced rates and complete sampling. This shows that joint inference of birth rate, death rate and sampling probability is not possible. The birth–death-sampling process is compared to the sampling-based population genetics model, the coalescent. It is shown that despite many similarities between these two models, the distribution of bifurcation times remains different even in the case of very large population sizes. We illustrate these findings on an Hepatitis C virus dataset from Egypt. We show that the transmission times estimates are significantly different—the widely used Gamma statistic even changes its sign from negative to positive when switching from the coalescent to the birth–death process.},

	abstract = {Host population structure has a major influence on epidemiological dynamics. However, in particular for sexually transmitted diseases, quantitative data on population contact structure are hard to obtain. Here, we introduce a new method that quantifies host population structure based on phylogenetic trees, which are obtained from pathogen genetic sequence data. Our method is based on a maximum-likelihood framework and uses a multi-type branching process, under which each host is assigned to a type (subpopulation). In a simulation study, we show that our method produces accurate parameter estimates for phylogenetic trees in which each tip is assigned to a type, as well for phylogenetic trees in which the type of the tip is unknown. We apply the method to a Latvian HIV-1 dataset, quantifying the impact of the intravenous drug user epidemic on the heterosexual epidemic (known tip states), and identifying superspreader dynamics within the men-having-sex-with-men epidemic (unknown tip states).},
