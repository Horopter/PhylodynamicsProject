Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [lambda, mu]
Sampling 4 chains for 500 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (2_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 3 seconds.
There were 860 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.01 for some parameters. This indicates problems during sampling. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08008 for details
The effective sample size per chain is smaller than 100 for some parameters.  A higher number is needed for reliable rhat and ess computation. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08008 for details
